## Data Dictionary - Tidy data set derived from UCI Machine Learning Repository * Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set *  


* Subject 
Range 1-30 
30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.

* Activity* 
<p>Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)</p>

### Measurements

<p>These measurements come from the accelerometer and gyroscope. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. </p>
<p>'-X -Y and -Z' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.<p>

<p>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-X,Y,Z and tBodyGyroJerk-X,Y,Z). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).</p>

<p>Suffixes mean(): Mean value and std(): Standard deviation are also used. </p>
